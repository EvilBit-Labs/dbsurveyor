- Current limitations or pain points
- Specific use cases that are difficult or impossible
- Workarounds currently being used

## Proposed Solution

Describe the solution you'd like to see implemented. Be specific about:

- New functionality or capabilities
- Changes to existing behavior
- New command-line options or configuration
- Output format changes

## Use Cases

Describe specific scenarios where this feature would be valuable:

1. **Use Case 1**: [Description]

   - Who: [Target user]
   - When: [When they would use this]
   - How: [How they would use this]
   - **Security**: Use redacted placeholders (e.g., `user:pass@host/db`) instead of real credentials

2. **Use Case 2**: [Description]

   - Who: [Target user]
   - When: [When they would use this]
   - How: [How they would use this]
   - **Security**: Use redacted placeholders (e.g., `user:pass@host/db`) instead of real credentials

## Security Considerations
