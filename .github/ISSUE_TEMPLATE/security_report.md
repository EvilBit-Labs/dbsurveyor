## Steps to Reproduce

**CRITICAL SECURITY**: Sanitize all sensitive data before submitting this report.

**REQUIRED SANITIZATION**:

- Remove/redact: Passwords, API keys, connection strings, IP addresses, hostnames
- Replace with: Placeholders like `[REDACTED]`, `user:pass@host/db`, `192.168.x.x`
- Sanitize: Stack traces, error messages, configuration files, log outputs
- Use: Generic descriptions that preserve the vulnerability without exposing sensitive details

**PRIVATE ARTIFACT SUBMISSION**:

- Sensitive artifacts (logs, configs, full stack traces): Email to security@[project-domain]
- Mark subject: `[PRIVATE] DBSurveyor Security Report - [Brief Description]`
- Include: Reference to this GitHub issue number for correlation

1. Environment setup: [Generic description - no specific IPs/hostnames]
2. Database configuration: [Sanitized connection details - use placeholders]
3. Command executed: [Command without sensitive data - redact credentials]
4. Vulnerability trigger: [What causes the issue - no sensitive paths/values]
5. Observed behavior: [What happens when exploited - sanitize any output]

## Proof of Concept

**IMPORTANT**: Provide a minimal, safe proof of concept that demonstrates the vulnerability without exposing sensitive data.

**SANITIZATION CHECKLIST**:

- [ ] No real credentials or connection strings
- [ ] No actual IP addresses or hostnames
- [ ] No sensitive file paths or configuration details
- [ ] No stack traces with sensitive information
- [ ] All output sanitized for sensitive data

```bash
# Safe reproduction steps (use placeholders for sensitive data)
dbsurveyor [command] [options]
# Example: dbsurveyor collect --database-url "postgres://user:pass@host/db"
```
