## Security Vulnerability Report

**CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities must be reported privately. Do NOT create public GitHub issues for security reports.

### Private Reporting Required

**This template is for reference only. To report a security vulnerability:**

1. **Use GitHub Security Advisories** (Recommended):
   - Go to this repository's **Security** tab
   - Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
   - This creates a private issue visible only to maintainers

2. **Email Security Team**:
   - **Email**: <security@evilbitlabs.io>
   - **Subject**: `[SECURITY] DBSurveyor - [Brief Description]`

3. **Consult SECURITY.md**:
   - See [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) for complete reporting instructions
   - Includes response timelines and security guarantees

### Why No Public Issues?

- **Confidentiality**: Security issues must remain private until resolved
- **Prevent Exploitation**: Public disclosure could enable attacks
- **Coordinated Response**: Maintainers need time to investigate and fix
- **User Protection**: Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information

**Do NOT fill out this template. Use the methods above for private reporting.**
