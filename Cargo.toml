# ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY NOTICE: This Cargo.toml enforces the following security guarantees:
#
# OFFLINE-ONLY OPERATION:
# - No dependencies that require network connectivity during runtime
# - All external network calls limited to initial dependency resolution
# - Feature flags allow building minimal versions for airgap environments
#
# NO TELEMETRY:
# - No analytics, crash reporting, or usage tracking dependencies
# - Logging is local-only with no external endpoints
# - Build process includes no external reporting mechanisms
#
# DATA SECURITY:
# - AES-GCM encryption with random nonces and authenticated headers
# - Argon2 for secure key derivation with configurable parameters
# - No credentials stored in dependency cache or build artifacts
#
# CI SECURITY CONTROLS:
# - Linting enforces security best practices (cargo clippy -- -D warnings)
# - Dependency auditing via cargo-audit and cargo-deny
# - SBOM generation compatible for supply chain security
# - Feature flags enable minimal builds for reduced attack surface
#
# AIRGAP COMPATIBILITY:
# - Minimal feature set supports completely disconnected environments
# - All required dependencies can be vendored for offline builds
# - Documentation generation works without external resources
# - Binary artifacts are self-contained with no runtime dependencies
